0) Dennis Agulo: you may tell Allan that transaction types can be hardcoded since 
its the same for all accounts and just add 'To Let' on it... nothing needed from API
- done

1.) Facebook Share is Not working:  https://www.screencast.com/t/JeHCGNq2s - fixed

2.) Allan, still getting complaints something is slow when our plugin is installed.  
Are we still calling out to any home junction scripts?  Like search forms, etc? - fixed

4.) https://www.screencast.com/t/j0vhiCqCyB Search Option does not work properly.. (Big Issue!) - fixed

3.) Photos on top of on another: Media received. To view it, go to:

- Jolo, to fix this one as this is template issue and the plugin the choose to use header and footer of the theme

5.) On Property Page, it shows values even though for example Lot area are sq ft  = 0.  
We need to not show 0 values.  See video: https://www.screencast.com/t/A1jCbow9Y2
- fixed

6.) On Property Page, “Type” and “Community” shows no value but should:https://www.screencast.com/t/ZbkkzdvyoZV
- type is fixed
- community, its working, if its not showing, need to reset the cache

7.) Google Map link (that you added does not work)  See video: https://www.screencast.com/t/VZQGbfoxd7Q
- The CRM Map let you drag and drop it, thus it gets the coordinate, the map in the property details, get the address in the CRM
- if that is the case, what I did is geocode the coordinates to formatted address.
- BUT this is not a permanent fix, since the google map api to convert coordinate to formatted address
IS LIMITED to certain request only. I suggest to put exact formatted address in the CRM
- The Link on the "Open Google Map" must be address, as it will not accept coordinates, 
please we need exact formatted address to get exact google map when clicked. 
- For now I convert coordinates (from CRM) and get formatted address, im not sure if its accurate

8.) When “No Properties meet the Search Criteria. Please Search Again” 
we need to maintain the Search script on top:  https://www.screencast.com/t/2uTLqLalv
